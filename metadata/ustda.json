FATAA provides the following principled exceptions: 1) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; 2) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; 3) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; or 4) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations.

There is not a one-to-one link between budget figures and the financial data - commitments and disbursements - for a given year.
